Objective-C-Singleton-Macro
===========================

This is a simple singleton enforcement macro.

The singleton implementation is primarily based off the Objective-C Phrasebook (2nd Edition) (Developer's Library) by David Chisnall.
The macro definition is inspired by the Google toolbox for mac.
